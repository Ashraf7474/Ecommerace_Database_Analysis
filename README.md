# --Introduction--

In this comprehensive E-commerce database analysis, we delve into the performance metrics of the platform to gain profound insights. We focus on critical indicators including highest sales, new customer acquisitions, revenue generation, top-selling products, and products with the highest profit margins. By harnessing the power of SQL queries, we extract valuable information from the database. Subsequently, we transform this data into an interactive and visually compelling Power BI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a window into the underlying data, providing a clear and actionable understanding of the platform's performance dynamics.

# --Problem aimed to solve--

Our analysis endeavors to provide a deeper understanding of the E-commerce platform's performance by dissecting vital metrics like sales, customer acquisition, revenue, and product profitability. Through an interactive Power BI dashboard, we intend to offer stakeholders actionable insights for informed decision-making and strategic enhancements, fostering the platform's growth and optimization.

# --Data Description-- 

The database comprises multiple CSV files containing diverse datasets, including customer information, order details, payment types, product data, order item specifics, shipper details, and seller records. These files collectively offer a comprehensive view of your e-commerce operations, enabling comprehensive analysis and informed decision-making.

# --Methodology--

The project methodology involves crafting SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the diverse CSV files, followed by the creation of an interactive dashboard. This approach leverages data analysis and visualization to provide actionable information for informed decision-making and strategic planning.

# --Phases--

Data Collection: Acquire the comprehensive database from Kaggle, encompassing multiple CSV files containing essential information such as customer data, order details, payment types, product data, and more.

SQL Query Development: Craft intricate SQL queries to efficiently extract valuable insights from the diverse datasets. These queries will uncover trends, relationships, and patterns within the data, providing a solid foundation for analysis.

Power BI Dashboard Creation: Utilize the extracted insights to design an interactive and visually engaging Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will present a comprehensive view of the e-commerce operations, offering stakeholders the ability to explore data and gain actionable insights.

PowerPoint Presentation: Compile the project's findings, methodologies, and dashboard visuals into a concise PowerPoint presentation. This presentation will serve as a medium to effectively communicate the project's results, insights, and potential business implications.

# Challenges Faced

In this comprehensive E-commerce database analysis project, our objective is to leverage SQL queries to extract crucial insights from a multitude of CSV files, covering customer data, order details, payment types, product information, and more. These insights will be transformed into an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of sales, customer acquisition, revenue generation, and product profitability.

Throughout the project, we anticipate challenges such as data quality issues, the complexity of SQL queries, and the design of an effective dashboard. We will address these challenges by implementing data cleaning techniques, breaking down complex queries, and following best practices in data visualization. Our ultimate goal is to empower decision-makers with actionable insights, fostering the growth and optimization of the E-commerce platform while ensuring data privacy and compliance with security protocols.
